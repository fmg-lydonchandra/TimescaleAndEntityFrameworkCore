# Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL and Timescale

The following repository holds an example of using Entity Framework Core with
PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop or equivalent
- .NET 7 Preview 6+

Before looking at the code in the repository, I recommend setting up a docker container with
a PostgreSQL database with the TimescaleDB extension enabled.

```bash
docker pull timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg14-latest
docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg14-latest
```

You'll also want the [sample data from TimescaleDocs](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/downloads/get-started/real_time_stock_data.zip). 

First, you'll want to run the database migrations in the solution.

```bash
dotnet tool restore
dotnet-ef database update
```

Next, you can follow the instructions on the [documentation page](https://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/latest/add-data/#ingest-the-dataset), or use JetBrains Rider database tools to import the data after running the **EF Core migrations**. The **Companies** table should be relatively quick, but the `Stocks` table will take a bit of time.

https://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/latest/time-series-data/
```psql
# quoted "Companies" to make it case sensitive
\COPY "Companies" from  './real_time_stock_data/tutorial_sample_company.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
\COPY "Stocks" from  './real_time_stock_data/tutorial_sample_tick.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```
## Running the Application

You can run the solution once your data has loaded. The resulting output should look like the following.

```console
Microsoft (MSFT): $266.39 - $260.34 ~$259.51

Process finished with exit code 0.
```

## The Important Bits

There are a few important things in this project that you'll want to take note of.

1. The use of the `[Keyless]` attribute. ([Read More here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/keyless-entity-types?tabs=data-annotations))

2. The addition to our first migration to make our `Stocks` table a `hypertable`.
    ```csharp
    // Convert Stocks Table to Hypertable
    // language=sql
    migrationBuilder.Sql(
        "SELECT create_hypertable( '\"Stocks\"', 'Time');\n" +
        "CREATE INDEX ix_symbol_time ON \"Stocks\" (\"Symbol\", \"Time\" DESC)"
    );
    ```
3. `Stocks` and `IntervalResults` are `read-only` collections. You'll need to determine an insert mechanism for adding new values to the `Stocks` table, but that could be a simple `ADO.NET` method, Dapper, or other inserting approach. This is time-series data, so there is no primary key, just a wave of information.
4. `DateTime` and `Ngpsql` are _funky_, and while it works, there's required knowledge you need to know to make it work. (https://www.npgsql.org/doc/types/datetime.html).

## Thoughts

> Is this the best approach?

I'm not really sure if it's the best approach, but it uses the mechanisms of EF Core 7. It definitely makes for less SQL, but at the cost of a lot of time and effort. In a team environment, this may be helpful in the long run to keep folks from making mistakes or introducing security issues (SQL Injection Attacks).

> So The Timescale Syntax Just Works?

Well, SQL Server treats our `IQueryable<IntervalResults>` like a table, allowing us to add additional filter options on the initial query. If you want to use specific functions from Timescale, you may want to create new database functions or execute raw sql. You'll still need to add the models to your DbContext in some capacity to make it work, similar to how I added `Stocks` and `IntervalResults`.

You can add more functionality to EF Core's sql interpreter, but I didn't want to go too far in this sample.

> What about Dapper?

Sure, you can use Dapper and keep your EF Core models separate from your Timescale/time-series data. The issue there is you'd have to figure out how to migrate Timescale tasks along-side EF Core tasks.

> What about Migrations? EF Core just knows how to do this?

Well, no it didn't. For Timescale, I ended up modifying migrations by hand to include timescale specific calls. This is fine as long as I hold true to **never modifying migrations that have been deployed.**
